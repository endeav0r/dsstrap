dsstrap: Debian Security bootSTRAP

Select offensive security packages for Debian Stable for the incredibly lazy.



BEGIN TUTORIAL:

1) Edit the lines at the beginning of dsstrap to reflect the directories you
want to store projects in, and where you want "bins" dropped. You may want to
add BIN_PATH to your shell PATH.

2) Try this:

dsstrap list
dsstrap install 0d1n
